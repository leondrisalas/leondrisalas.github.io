Hi there, modifying the initial post to show a brief info about the project.

Already have modified the new post, simply changing things for this post to get an idea about how it works.

If you want to learn more about Jekyll, just check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] and get the most out of Jekyll.
